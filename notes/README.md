# Notes Directory

Internal project notes, session context, and planning documents. Not part of the production codebase.

## Contents

- **session-log.md** — Where we left off, what's next, decisions made
- *(More files will be added as needed)*

## Purpose

- Maintain context between AI sessions
- Track decisions and their rationale
- Keep exploratory/verbose notes separate from terse copilot-instructions
- Reduce friction by having "state" documented

## Note

This directory is gitignored. Be verbose and exploratory here.
